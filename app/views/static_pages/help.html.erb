<h3>Introduction</h3>	

<p>&nbsp;</p>
This Help File describes functionality of Walk-In EMR at the staff user level. Similar documents for administrative and doctor pages are available on request.
Walk-In EMR (WEMR from now on for short) is patient management system developed for busy walk-in clinic setting using Ruby On Rails with Postgres back end. 

The system is easy to use, fully customizable and can be changed to accomodate other settings, including hospital and family practice.
Although the goal of the system is paperless office, WEMR can handle any combination of paper/digital workflows, which makes it easy to transition to digital office at the speed comfortable for the clinic staff. Majority of documents are generated on the fly in industry-standard PDF format and stored either in Amazon Cloud (AWS) or locally on the server. 

Simplicity is the ultimate priority of the WEMR. All menus and pages are laid out in consitent and predictable way and are functionally familiar to allow for intuitive use and minimal downtime associated with learning. As a matter of fact, staff can productively use the system after short introductory session. Computer literate secretary should be able to use the system without any formal training, after just reading this manual.

Most pages are self-explanatory and require no additional learning. Staff that had previous expierience with any EMR should be able to start using the system productively from day 1. 

System allows for Amazon Web Services (AWS) document cloud storage as well as local to the server directory storage.

<h3>User Categories</h3>

<p>
EMR supports 4 user categories: 
<dt class="col-sm-1">Staff User </dt><dd class="col-sm-11">Reserved to clinic staff, this user class has most privileges as far as creating, viewing and editing data, but cannot perform destructive actions and administrative functions. For example past billed visits cannot be changed by staff in any way except addition of certain information. Staff can generate any documents, including daily doctor's reports and monthly pay stubs, create invoices and letters, specialist referrals and generate patient forms. </dd></dt>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<dt class="col-sm-1">Doctor</dt><dd class="col-sm-11">Doctors have access only to pages relevant to them. They cannot view patient registry, perform admin functions or view other doctors' pages. Some of the functions are limited to viewing only. This includes billing functions, list of medications, diagnoses and service codes, insurance providers etc. Still, doctors have full functionality as far as daysheet during their work hours and can assign diagnoses and service codes to visits during those hours. They also have access to most documents and reference pages relevant to their patients including patient chart. They can generate their own billing reports, create letters, referrals and other documents relating to their patients.</dd>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<dt class="col-sm-1">Admin</dt><dd class="col-sm-11"> Users of this class have full system privileges and can perform destructive functions not accessible to ather user classes including deleting visits and patient records with all related information. This category should be used with caution by experienced user in rare cases of corrupt or erroneous data. Functions available to admin users only currentlyinclude following pages:
<p>
<li> Export Files </li>
<li> EDT files </li>
<li> Monthly Budget </li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<dt class="col-sm-1">Patient</dt><dd class="col-sm-11"> It's up to the clinic staff to enable patients to use the system. In case such a desision is made, each registered patient will have access to his profile, chart and visit history. Eventually they will also have possiblity to make an appointment and renew prescriptions under certain conditions. Patient pages are currently under development and once ready could be used as paid subsciption service.

</dd>

<div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
<div class="panel panel-info text-justify">
<div class="panel-heading">User Class Assignment</div>
  <div class="panel-body">
User class is assigned by administrator during user setup which works as follows: administrator creates user by registering name and email and assigning user class. After this information is saved into database, confirmation email is sent automatically to the newly registered user. This email contains activation link. By clicking this link the user is taken to their profile page, where they can assign new password only known to them. After this step new user can log into system remotely from any desktop or mobile device and have access to all pages accessible by their user class. Forgotten password is emaild to user's registered email on request. Activation links expire in 2 hours (this is customizable parameter).

<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>
At the start of the day, after logging in as a staff member, you first have to select the doctor for the shift. Use [Set Doctor] drop-down menu in the Day Sheet navigation bar for this. Selected doctor will become default for all the new visits until changed at the beginning of the next shift. When patient comes in, after you slide the card in card reader (this is typically done in Patients or Daysheet page) you will get either
<%= link_to "New Patient", "#", remote: device_is_desktop?, 'data-toggle':  "modal", 'data-target': '#new_patient_form_modal' %>, or existing 

<%= link_to "Patient Profile", "#", remote: device_is_desktop?, 'data-toggle':  "modal", 'data-target': '#patient_profile_modal' %> 
patient form, depending on wether the patient is already in the system or not. 

</p>

<p>
In patient profile page you can see patient demographics, visit history, health history notes and all related documentaion including invoices, letters and doctor referrals. Visit history on the right shows concise view of which doctor has seen the patient last as well as diagnosis and service codes. Status in the last column will tell you wether associated claim was submitted ("Billed") or processed ("Paid"). All other statuses are used to describe different stages of the claim and are self-explanatory. You can see every visit's details by cliking on the link in the first column. 
</p>

<p>
There's set of buttons under patient demographics panel in patient profile page. To create new visit you would use [New Visit] button, which will take you to <%= link_to "New Visit Form", "#", remote: device_is_desktop?, 'data-toggle':  "modal", 'data-target': '#new_visit_form_modal' %>.
To edit patient profile you would use [Edit Patient] button. And so on. To create new visit, just click [New Visit] button. You don't have to change anything on the new visit form initialy, although you can change timestamp from default to some point in the pass for occasionaly missed visits. This is an exception rather than the rule however. You can specify reason for the visit at this point, but the rest can be filled later, when more information is available.  
</p>

<p> 
Current day's visits, as well as unbilled visits from previous days, will appear in Day Sheet in chronological order withing their status category. This means that visits marked as 'Arrived' will be listed first, from newest to oldest, then 'Assessed', 'Ready To Bill', 'Billed' and 'Paid'. So, newly arrived people will be listed first by default. All unbilled visits from previous days as well as current day's visits are editable, but once the claims are submitted and billing reference is assigned to each one of them, they become read-only with the only exception: you can always add cash service to the visit, even if it was previously billed. Cash services are not submitted to OHIP, so this is perfectly fine for cases when patients come back the next day with the cash payment for example.
</p>

<p>
Although default sort order is by date/time descending within each billing category, visits shown in Day Sheet can also be sorted by Timestamp and Status by clicking on corresponding table headers. Sorting order will alternate between Ascending and Descending by repeatedly clicking the header link.
</p>

<p>
Room drop-down (second column in daysheet table) is used to keep track of which patient is in which room. Initially it shows 'W', which stands for 'Waiting Room'. When the room is selected, visit status changes to "With Doctor" automatically. From now on visit will be shown below the list of visits marked as 'ARRIVED'. When doctor is finished with the patient and room becomes available you would assign same room number to the next available 'ARRIVED' visit. When you do this, status of the visit previously marked as 'WITH DOCTOR' and using the same room will change to 'ASSESSED' and will move down below all 'WITH DOCTOR' visits.
<p>

<p>
As the day progresses and information about patients becomes available, you will fill required missing fields for the visit and once finished change the status to 'READY TO BILL' for OHIP insured visits (HCP,RMB,WCB), 'BILLED' to visits insured by the 3-rd party insurance (IFH) or invoiced, and 'PAID' for cash visits. These 3 categories by default will be shown at the bottom of Day Sheet. 'READY TO BILL' visits will appear in Billing -> Daily Billing page. Once all visits in Day Sheet are shown in billing page, [Send To OHIP] button will be show at the bottom of the billing page. I's advisable to submit claims using this button at the end of each work day.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a id="navigation"></a>
<h3>Navigation and Search</h3>
All menus are located in navigation bar, most of them are Drop-Downs. Depending on the menu in use navigation bar will also have search box or date control. Day Sheet and Daily Billing pages use date control, the rest of the menus will have search box. There's also [Set Doctor] Drop-Down that lets you select the doctor for the shift.  Current doctor is sticky until changed. New visits will have this doctor preselected. Searches are page-sensitive.
For example, Patients page allows to search patients by Last Name, Date of Birth or Health number. To navigate between pages, there's page control at the bottom of the screen. Also, you can use <left> and <right> arrow buttons on your keyboard to step through pages that have navigation controls at the bottom.
